# Wine-Quality-Prediction

  This is an amazing dataset to get yourself familiar with the stastical basics of Data Science. 

It requires a fair deal of preprocessing and feauture selection for a trained model to perform better. 
  
  As in my case no feature selection was done, therefore my ANN has troubles recognizing wine of highest quality, to be more specific it cannot classify it correctly even once. 

And yet after 70 epochs accuracy of 83% can be achieved with the simplest approach.

It was a lot of fun to work with this dataset.
